====================
java comes from diffrent vendors with different folder structure.
below are the types of java softwares.
1)Open JDK---this is from redhat company
2)Oracle JDK---this is from Oracle
3)JRocket kit----This is from Oracle weblogic

>>In java we are having 3 flavours
1)JSE/J2SE(java standard edition)---is used for designing desktop apps.
2)JEE/J2EE(java Enterprise Edition)---is used for designing web and enterprise apps.
3)JME/J2ME(java Mobile/Micro edition)---is used for designing mobile or embeded apps.
There is no corre java and advanced java seperatly.
>>>>Desktop app: ANy s/w which can be installed is called as desktop app.

Example: msoffice

Any app which we access thru browser is called as web app.

s/w--- system s/w and app softwares
System s/w:these s/w are essential to make your PC work. Ex: O/s
App S/w:s/w that are used for personal purpose is called as App s/w.
Example: MS office,paint,photoshop

Java
------
>>java supports big data/AI.
>>if i had a new PC with O/s,will i have java in that machine?
ans) JRE

All browsers will by default powered with JRE.
JRE---java runtime Environment
JVM--Java virtual machine
JIT Compiler---Just intime compiler
JDK--java devlopment Kit

JDK provides necessary tools to write/compile code.

jdk is not JVM.

javac Hellow.java
java Hellow

javac is a tool to compile java code.
javac/java is part of bin folder.

Open notepad
write the codesave the file with "classname.java"
save it

machine language means 0,1
Byte code is a combination of 1,0 and some special symbols generated by JVM.
Example:

Hellow.java------>compile----->Run the code
                  javac 		java
				  
				  Running the java code will be taken care by JVM.
				  
				  JVM will convert byte code to machine code.
				  
				  After compiling java code,we will get class file.
				  
>using decompiler tool,we can convert class file(byte code) to source code.
Note: decompilers are not allowed in all organizations.
Decompiler tool is not part of jdk,it is 3rd part tool.

Source code: code written by developer.
Byte code:Byte code is a combination of 1,0 and some special symbols generated by JVM.
Machine code: 0,1

JVM is part of JRE
---------------------------------------------
Architecture neutrality:

windows--all windows o/s will work on windows architecture (win32 api calls)
Linux---all linux flavours used kernel mode and linux architecture
mac---macintosh arch
Sunsolaris....etc

Java slogan---WODA---Write once deploy anywhere

bytecode--can run on


loader is a s/w program whose job is to load ur class to memory.
Application Loader:loads the classes that are part of app.
Bootstrap Loader: loads core java classes which are predefined that are required for JVM to function.
Extension loader: loads third party classes or extensions

In java,if any thing starts with "native" that indicates that function/class is written in other language ie c or C++.

Garbage Collector: GC. GC job is reallocate/remove unwanted/unused objects from heap memory.

java doent support Garbage values.Java doesnt support pointers explicitly.It uses internally for memory allocation..
C and C++ there is Garbage value concept,because it supports pointers. 
=====================================
winzip----compress files and folders.

like above

in java when we want share code we can share in below formats.
1)jar--java archive-----desktop apps and web apps
technologies: springboot,core java,Swing,AWT
2)war--web archieve----webapp
technologies:spring MVC,springboot,servlets,jsp
3)ear---enterprise archieve----enterprise apps
technologies: EJB

jar consists of class files and config files.
war consists of html,css,js,servlets/jsp and config files
ear--consists of ejb classes and necessary config files



jar/war/ear is called as packaging in java.

to create jar or war or ear,we can use jar command.

in projects,we use MAVEN to create packaging.Gradle

>maven is inbuilt in Eclipse.
=============================================
Datatypes
---------

2,3--integer
3.12---float
srinivaskolaparthi---varchar
+---operator

datatype: datatype specifies the type of that that we need to use.

any thing which you declare within a block is called AS LOCAL and it can be accessible only within that block.
{
}---unnamed Block

add()
{
//idf we 
}----named block

//global variable can be accessed from any block.


datatype variablename;

; is called as terminator in  Java.

always within a block local variables will have more priority than global.

comments: 

single line comments: //
Multiline Comments: /*
*/
----Always Classname first letter shld be Upper case.
In relatime,default is not allowed.We shld not create any java class in default package.it is strictly not allowed in any organizations.
>>package means it is a folder.
by default if we define any varaible with decimal point,it will be "double".

2.345

\n---new line character
i want to store  a paragraph?

------------>Rules
1)In a single java program we can have any no of classes.
2)In a single java program we can have only one public class.
3)Alwyas filename and public class name shld be same.
4)i can have class with in a class ie nested classes.
5)we cannt use static in front of a  class.only public ,abstract and final are allowed for a class.
6)A class casn be private and static only in the case of inner classes.
7)A public class shld have main method for sure
8) We shld not write the code outside the class.

i/p:Java Fullstack
expected o/p: jAVA fULLSTACK 

Always we recommend you to use predefined API.because these are tested and proved.

>>In java main accepts some parameters which are of type string array
if we want to pass some input to main method ,we can do it via command line arguments.

>>>>Static:
-Static is no way releated to Objects.
-static contents are loaded first and then non static.
-Always main method shld be static.
static contents are loaded first--VVIP
Non static are loaded when you creat Object,otherwise not--economy

Static doent know anything about non-static
Non static know static contents. 
>variable,method and a class can be static.But class can be static only in the case of inner classes.
