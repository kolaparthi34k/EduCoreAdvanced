2-Feb-2024--Day1
====================
java comes from diffrent vendors with different folder structure.
below are the types of java softwares.
1)Open JDK---this is from redhat company
2)Oracle JDK---this is from Oracle
3)JRocket kit----This is from Oracle weblogic

>>In java we are having 3 flavours
1)JSE/J2SE(java standard edition)---is used for designing desktop apps.
2)JEE/J2EE(java Enterprise Edition)---is used for designing web and enterprise apps.
3)JME/J2ME(java Mobile/Micro edition)---is used for designing mobile or embeded apps.
There is no corre java and advanced java seperatly.
>>>>Desktop app: ANy s/w which can be installed is called as desktop app.

Example: msoffice

Any app which we access thru browser is called as web app.

s/w--- system s/w and app softwares
System s/w:these s/w are essential to make your PC work. Ex: O/s
App S/w:s/w that are used for personal purpose is called as App s/w.
Example: MS office,paint,photoshop

Java
------
>>java supports big data/AI.
>>if i had a new PC with O/s,will i have java in that machine?
ans) JRE

All browsers will by default powered with JRE.
JRE---java runtime Environment
JVM--Java virtual machine
JIT Compiler---Just intime compiler
JDK--java devlopment Kit

JDK provides necessary tools to write/compile code.

jdk is not JVM.

javac Hellow.java
java Hellow

javac is a tool to compile java code.
javac/java is part of bin folder.

Open notepad
write the codesave the file with "classname.java"
save it

machine language means 0,1
Byte code is a combination of 1,0 and some special symbols generated by JVM.
Example:

Hellow.java------>compile----->Run the code
                  javac 		java
				  
				  Running the java code will be taken care by JVM.
				  
				  JVM will convert byte code to machine code.
				  
				  After compiling java code,we will get class file.
				  
>using decompiler tool,we can convert class file(byte code) to source code.
Note: decompilers are not allowed in all organizations.
Decompiler tool is not part of jdk,it is 3rd part tool.

Source code: code written by developer.
Byte code:Byte code is a combination of 1,0 and some special symbols generated by JVM.
Machine code: 0,1

JVM is part of JRE
---------------------------------------------
Architecture neutrality:

windows--all windows o/s will work on windows architecture (win32 api calls)
Linux---all linux flavours used kernel mode and linux architecture
mac---macintosh arch
Sunsolaris....etc

Java slogan---WODA---Write once deploy anywhere

bytecode--can run on


loader is a s/w program whose job is to load ur class to memory.
Application Loader:loads the classes that are part of app.
Bootstrap Loader: loads core java classes which are predefined that are required for JVM to function.
Extension loader: loads third party classes or extensions

In java,if any thing starts with "native" that indicates that function/class is written in other language ie c or C++.

Garbage Collector: GC. GC job is reallocate/remove unwanted/unused objects from heap memory.

java doent support Garbage values.Java doesnt support pointers explicitly.It uses internally for memory allocation..
C and C++ there is Garbage value concept,because it supports pointers. 
=====================================
winzip----compress files and folders.

like above

in java when we want share code we can share in below formats.
1)jar--java archive-----desktop apps and web apps
technologies: springboot,core java,Swing,AWT
2)war--web archieve----webapp
technologies:spring MVC,springboot,servlets,jsp
3)ear---enterprise archieve----enterprise apps
technologies: EJB

jar consists of class files and config files.
war consists of html,css,js,servlets/jsp and config files
ear--consists of ejb classes and necessary config files



jar/war/ear is called as packaging in java.

to create jar or war or ear,we can use jar command.

in projects,we use MAVEN to create packaging.Gradle

>maven is inbuilt in Eclipse.
=============================================
Datatypes
---------

2,3--integer
3.12---float
srinivaskolaparthi---varchar
+---operator

datatype: datatype specifies the type of that that we need to use.

any thing which you declare within a block is called AS LOCAL and it can be accessible only within that block.
{
}---unnamed Block

add()
{
//idf we 
}----named block

//global variable can be accessed from any block.


datatype variablename;

; is called as terminator in  Java.

always within a block local variables will have more priority than global.

comments: 

single line comments: //
Multiline Comments: /*
*/
----Always Classname first letter shld be Upper case.
In relatime,default is not allowed.We shld not create any java class in default package.it is strictly not allowed in any organizations.
>>package means it is a folder.
by default if we define any varaible with decimal point,it will be "double".

2.345

\n---new line character
i want to store  a paragraph?

------------>Rules
1)In a single java program we can have any no of classes.
2)In a single java program we can have only one public class.
3)Alwyas filename and public class name shld be same.
4)i can have class with in a class ie nested classes.
5)we cannt use static in front of a  class.only public ,abstract and final are allowed for a class.
6)A class casn be private and static only in the case of inner classes.
7)A public class shld have main method for sure
8) We shld not write the code outside the class.

i/p:Java Fullstack
expected o/p: jAVA fULLSTACK 

Always we recommend you to use predefined API.because these are tested and proved.

>>In java main accepts some parameters which are of type string array
if we want to pass some input to main method ,we can do it via command line arguments.

>>>>Static:
-Static is no way releated to Objects.
-static contents are loaded first and then non static.
-Always main method shld be static.
static contents are loaded first--VVIP
Non static are loaded when you creat Object,otherwise not--economy

Static doent know anything about non-static
Non static know static contents. 
>variable,method and a class can be static.But class can be static only in the case of inner classes.
=========================================================
Day 2
-----
conditional statements
Loops

Character:

char e = 'w';

In ATMS and kiosk machines,java Internationalization feature.

>>Java supports Internationalization -i18n
>>java achived this through unicode supports.
>>>if unicode is supported by any programming language then that language also supports i18n.
>>UNicode---Universal Code.
by default all editors supports english--ie UTF-8/ANSI.
>>in java to display some thing on to screen,we need to use character.
1 byte is sufficient to display some thing in english.But to display other than english language,we need have 2 bytes.
So officlially,in java character occupies 2 bytes.
https://unicode.org/charts/
=================================
>>Type Casting:converting from one datatype to another type.
char e ='2';

2 types of castings.
1)Implicit: jvm will do convertion to another type on backend. 
2)Explicit: developer shld write necessary logic to do conversion.

Small talk,eiffel---pure object oriented

=======================================
>>Wrapper classes:wrapper classes provides a mechanism to convert primitive to object and vice versa.
1.5 version

in java there is primitive data type support.
>When we say object oriented ,it shld nt support primitivrs,but java supports.Later they realease wrapper classes.

javac -target <version no> -source <version no>

int---Primitive--- Integer--wrapper-class represtation of int.
char---Character

primitive to object conversion is called as autoboxing.this is automatic ie JVM will lookafter.
reverse is unboxing.

>>Reason why it shld be Object?
Serialization and deserialization

Observations
=============
1)USe getNumericValue() method maily for unicode characters
2)BAsed on the given data,wisely choose which wrapper class suports us to perform casting.


>,<,>=,<=,||,&&,%,/
Conditional Statements:
=========================
if--
if-else
Switch:
--------
>switch can have any no of cases.No limit
>recommend to add default for every switch case.
>Every case shld have break.break will instruct JVM to come out of switch statement when it reaches end of the case..
>from java 1.8 ,we can use strings even in switch.Only int values, strings or enum variables are permitted.
>Switch within switch is possible.

>>Strings cannt be compared using ==.In javascript for deep comparision,we are having === operator.But in java we dont.Instead we can use equals method.

We can concatinate 2 strings using "concat" function.else we can also use "+" symbol.
Stringbuffer stringbuilder
Every Object in java will have unique no for identification like aadhar no for us.

In java to find out that unique no /address,we need to use hashcode()
hashcode is unique across objects,but it might be same only in some cases
Note: primite datatypes dont have hashcode.
in Strings there is a concept called as String literal/Constant Pool.This Pool concept is based on hashcode techqnics.

Loops:
======

A loop is a block of code that executes repeatedly until condition fails.
1)for 
2)while
3)do-while
4)for each----Collections


Eclipse----->Git---->Github---->Security OWASP Scanner-->Sonarqube(code quality testing tool)--->Jenkins--->test server---->Docker hub--->Tomcat

Sonarqube will scan your project for duplicate code,security voilations,coding vioalations,bugs..etc.if voilation is more than the allowed percentage,simply it will not qllow us to move to next layer.

if any duplicate code is a found by sonarqube,it will not allow your code move to next phase,then ultimetly code will fail.
>>>
break: it will break exceution of the loop ie it will come out of the loop.
continue:it will not come out of the loop,but it will skip the exceution of the block for given condition.

>Nested Loop:
loop with in loop is called as Nested Loops.

Return
=======
>return is used for returning some values to called environment.
>return also will return control back to calle environment.
>if we add retrun in main,u are passing controll to JVM.

final is used for declaring constants.
Rules to follow while writing class:
---------------------------------------
>always make sure variables in a class are private.
>methods shld be public.
>Classname first letter shld be upper case.
>always a functionsubstring shld start with upper case
>Always constants shld be in Upper case.A singletter canot be a constant.
>>>Always constants shld be initialized.

Java Beans(POJO)
================
>>pojos are mainly used in Spring ,Springboot and JPA frameworks.
>pojo stands for plain old java object.
>Pojo means a class with below rules and regulation.
-------
1)Pojo classses will not have main method.
2)Property shld be private and methods shld be public.
3)pojo classes shld have setters and getters for each property.
4)Pojo classes shld not implement interfaces.
5)We shld not write business or db logic in pojo.
6)Pojo classes will not have any abstract method.
7)It shld have no argument constructor.
8)static is not allowed in pojo.
9)Always pojo classes shld be in a sperate package.never keep pojo in default.

setter for pushing
getter---for pulling
