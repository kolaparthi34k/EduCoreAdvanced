Spring Security is a framework that enables a programmer to impose security restrictions to Spring-framework–based Web applications through JEE components.
>Spring Security operates in two major areas: Authentication and Authorization.

Authentication
==============
Authentication means that, while accessing certain restricted resources, the user actually is the right person to do so. There are two processes to make sure 
that the user is authentic: identification and verification. For example, a user is authenticated through their username and password, which is typically stored
in a database.

Authorization
==============
Authorization determines the extent of a user’s right to access restricted resources. It ensures that a user is allowed to access only those parts of the resource 
that one has been authorized to use. The user roles come as part of the authorization.

Enabling spring security on a spring boot application is so simple. Just add the spring security dependency in the pom.xml
<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
		</dependency>

Spring Security supports integration with all of these technologies.
